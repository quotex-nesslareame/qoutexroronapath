## What is day trading?

Day trading means trading financial markets within the trading day. With
day trading, open positions are not carried overnight, but rather closed
within one trading day.

The analyzed time period depends primarily on the day trade strategy.
Successful day traders do not recommend using timeframes less than 15
minutes.

There are two types of day trading:

1.  Scalping uses timeframes from 1 to 30 minutes.
2.  News trading is intraday trading, in which day traders, including
    swing traders, take into account news factors in addition to
    fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Professional traders
    know how world events affect the market and take them into account.
    The timeframes suitable for this type of day trading are 15 minutes,
    30 minutes and one hour.

## Why Are Chart Patterns Important

Chart patterns are important in trading because they are closely
intertwined with the psychology of price action. Price chart analysis
first appeared in the 17th century.

It is more convenient to analyze asset\'s price patterns in a
candlestick type of chart, since Japanese candlesticks provide more
information: price opening and closing, price movement high and low. It
is important not to confuse price pattern analysis with candlestick
chart pattern analysis, which is based on assessing the appearance of
one bearish or bullish candle.

As a rule, candlestick patterns are cyclical and repeat the movement,
forming price patterns in the form of figures. Based on these
candlestick patterns, a professional trader and a beginner can predict
further price movement and open profitable trades, setting clear goals
for this movement.

Examples of price candlestick charts are such stock chart patterns as
double bottom, double top, head and shoulders chart patterns, inverted
head and shoulders, rising wedges and falling wedges, flag, ascending
triangle, descending triangle, and others.

Chart patterns are an essential tool for traders to analyze market
movements and make informed decisions. These patterns provide insights
into the psychology of market participants and help traders identify
potential trends and reversals.

### Cup and Handle

Cup and Handle


In this fifteen-minute EURUSD chart you can see an example how to
recognize patterns of cup and handle. In the current situation, it was
possible to open a trade after the chart pattern was completely formed
and the broken resistance level was retested. The picture shows that the
resistance became a support level, and a bullish hammer candlestick
pattern has formed above it. Exiting the handle was a long position
signal. The price movement is calculated from the bottom of the cup to
the resistance or higher. The stop loss should be placed below the newly
formed support line.

narrowing of price swing highs and swing lows. In the current case, it
is difficult to predict the movement of the quotes. There is a
considerably high risk of bearish and bullish traps which can lead to
losing money rapidly, which is why it is important to wait for the
triangle to be confirmed up or down and the price to consolidate higher.
It is advisable to wait until the price tests the broken level.

Price movement implies a symmetrical increase or decrease in quotes.

bears and bulls. In the current situation, before making a decision,
wait for the breakdown of the triangle up or down. Stop loss should be
placed in the middle of the narrowing channel. For a more accurate
picture, japanese candlestick patterns' analysis should be used.

The bears made an attempt to break through the lower border of the
triangle, however, the bulls repelled the attack, thus forming a bearish
trap of candle squeeze.

In this case, you need to wait for the final consolidation of the price,
and then open a trade.

#### Ascending Triangle

resistance line. Upon reaching it the quotes reverse, forming rising
lows. After consolidation, the asset price breaks through this
resistance level, and the price continues to rise by the height of the
ascending triangle.
